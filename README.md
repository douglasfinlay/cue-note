## About

CueNote is a desktop utility to remotely add and edit notes in an Eos show file.

## Getting Started

### Prebuilt Binary

CueNote is available for Windows and macOS. Download the latest binary for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/douglasfinlay/cue-note/releases) page.

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

#### Steps

1. Clone this repository

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:douglasfinlay/cue-note.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

3. Run

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

## Usage

Connect to an Eos console via IP address or hostname. Please ensure _Third Party OSC_ is enabled.

### Quick Note Buttons

Right-click on a quick note button to change its text. This will automatically
